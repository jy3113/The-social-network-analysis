# The-social-network-analysis

Social networks analysis, the main body of a social network is usually a person. Each person is a node, and the relationship between people is an edge. The relationship has strength, direction, and nature. Its foundation is the graph theory of discrete mathematics. Then through some calculations to calculate the degree of aggregation, the average value or something. A higher level of data analysis can also be achieved through programming. In the research of social network analysis, what are the rules of spread of information in time, space and even geographic dimensions, and what are the key nodes? This has a greater degree of relevance to complex networks.

Therefore, the focus of social network analysis is on relationships and relationship patterns, and the methods and methods used are conceptually different from traditional statistical analysis and data processing methods.



# Degree Centrality.

Degree Centrality is the most direct metric to describe node Centrality in network analysis. The higher the node degree of a node is, the higher the degree centrality of the node is, and the more important the node is in the network. 

Betweeness centrality measures the extent to which a point is "in the middle" of other "point pairs" in the graph. If an actor is between several pairs of actors, then his degree is generally low. This relatively low degree point may play an important "intermediary" role and therefore be at the center of the network. According to this idea, the centrality of the point can be measured.

According to the "Bestfrineds", I could see that students with #8 has the highest degree centrality for the best friends measure.

According to the "geton", I could see that students with #11 has the highest degree centrality for get-on-with measure.

According to the "workwith", I could see that student with #6 has the highest degree centrality for work-with measure.



# Network structure

These metrics tell me that there have mutual connections between each other. 



# Summary

Through the analysis, it can be seen that student #8 has the highest score in the best friends network, so I think he is the most popular student, so he can hold some important positions in the class, such as monitor. I remember when I was in grade seven, there was a most popular boy in my class. He was the monitor of our class. All the students would obey his orders and he could manage our class in an orderly way.
